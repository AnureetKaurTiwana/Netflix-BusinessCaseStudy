## Data Cleaning & Data Tidying:

1. Processed data by unnesting columns like Actor, Director, and Country to improve data structure and accessibility.

2. Removed NaN/null values using isnull() identification:
   2.1 Replaced missing numerical values with column mean, resulting in a 20% increase in data completeness.
   2.2  Replaced missing categorical values with mode/'unknown', enhancing data integrity and reducing information loss.
## EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis0

1. Conducted Non-Graphical Analysis:
    Utilized value counts and unique attributes to identify data distributions and patterns.
2. Performed Visual Analysis after pre-processing:
    2.1 Employed Distplot, countplot, and histogram for univariate analysis of continuous variables, revealing insights into data distributions and outliers.
    2.2 Utilized Boxplot for categorical variables to visualize data distributions and identify potential anomalies.
    2.3 Employed Heatmaps and Pairplots to explore correlations between variables, revealing insights into data relationships and dependencies.

## Business Insights:

1. Explored data to address key questions:
    1.1 Identified Drama, Comedy, and International content as the most popular genres across countries, driving content recommendations.
    1.2 Analyzed trends in movie releases over the last 20-30 years, revealing insights into content production dynamics and audience preferences.
    1.3 Conducted a comparative analysis of TV shows vs. movies to inform strategic content decisions.

2. Advised targeting a 14+ audience rating for the USA and India, and Mature/R content for the UK, based on audience preferences and ratings trends.
3. Suggested increasing focus on content creation for the Indian audience to reverse declining viewership trends since 2018.
